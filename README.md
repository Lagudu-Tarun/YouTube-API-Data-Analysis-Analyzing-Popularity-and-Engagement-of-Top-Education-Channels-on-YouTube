# YouTube-API-Data-Analysis-Analyzing-Popularity-and-Engagement-of-Top-Education-Channels-on-YouTube

## Introduction:

This project aims to analyze the performance of three prominent educational channels on YouTube : Great
Learning,Simplilearn, and Intellipaat.
These are e-learning platforms that offer courses and tutorials related to various topics in technology and
business.

The project uses the YouTube API to extract data such as the number of subscribers, views, likes, and
comments for each channel. The data collected is then analyzed to gain insights into the popularity and
engagement of each channel.
The project intends to provide a comprehensive analysis of the three educational channels,
enabling us to understand their performance and audience engagement.

## Tools Used

This project was built using the following tools:

- Python : Programming language used to write the code for this project.
- pandas : Data manipulation library used to handle the data extracted from YouTube API.
- Matplotlib :  Data visualization library used to create charts and graphs for analysis.
- seaborn : Data visualization library used to create advanced statistical plots.


## Tasks Performed

1) Extracted channel id's of the desired youtube channels.
2) Retrieved channel statistics such as subscriber count,views, and video count, then create a plot to visualize
the data.
3) Acquired video details of the channels using Video Id's.
4) Calculated the total & average number of views, likes, and comments for each channel and create a plot
to visualize the data.
5) Calculate viewer the engagement rate for each channel.
6) Obtained the top 10 performing videos for each channel based on views and likes.

## Conclusions

When we observe the graphs of GreatLearning & Simplilearn, it appears that there is a difference between
the videos with the most views and those with the most likes. Specifically, videos with the most views tend
to be advertisements with hashtags, while videos with the most likes tend to be tutorials related to various
topics in technology.

From this observation, we can draw following conclusions:

The audience's viewing behavior differs from their engagement behavior: The difference in the videos with
the most views versus the most likes suggests that the audience's viewing behavior may differ from their
engagement behavior. In other words, viewers may be more likely to watch advertisements, but they engage
more with tutorial videos.

Hashtags may be effective in increasing views: The fact that videos with hashtags tend to have more views
suggests that the use of hashtags may be effective in increasing the visibility of videos and attracting
viewers.

Tutorials may be more valuable to the audience: The fact that tutorial videos tend to have more likes
suggests that the audience may value educational content related to various topics in technology. This
insight may be useful for the edtech company in deciding which types of videos to produce in the future.

In 2023, GreatLearning uploaded 10 videos and had a average of 2703.2 views.
Intellipaat uploaded 231 videos and had a average of 4050.982832618026 views.
Simplilearn uploaded 529 videos and had a average of 8947.44990548204 views.
The total engagement rate for Intellipaat is 2.39%,
whereas 2.25% for GreatLearning and 2.29% for Simplilearn.
Even though there isn't musch difference, Intellipaat has the highest engagement rate.
